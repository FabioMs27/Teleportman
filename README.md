# Teleportman
Game project made using the Game Maker engine and GML (Game Maker Language) that works similarly like C++.

It's a 2D puzzler which has Teleport as it's main mechanic. In the game you progress by solving puzzles and reaching the end of each level. It has a huge enphasis on Game Design and Level Design where the player learns and put to test new introduced mechanics like for example:

* Color blocks that becomes visible when a switch is pressed;
* Warping;
* 2 diferent ways of teleporting;
* Ammunition management;
* Bounce;
* Controlling 2 characters at once;
* Spikes;

The game is a continuation of my first demo. So it also has a custom physics, file saving and other things borrowed from that project. It has 15 levels and more than 40 rooms, but the game is lacking in Design and hasn't been finished yet.
